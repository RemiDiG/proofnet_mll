# MLL Proof nets for Yalla

Formalization of linear logic proof-nets for multiplicative linear logic in the spirit of the [Yalla library](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/olivier.laurent/yalla/).

Requires:
- [OLlibs](https://github.com/olaure01/ollibs) (add-ons for the standard library): [see installation instructions](https://github.com/olaure01/ollibs/blob/master/README.md).
- [Graph Theory](https://github.com/coq-community/graph-theory) (library for graphs): [see installation instructions](https://github.com/coq-community/graph-theory/blob/master/README.md).
- [Mczify](https://github.com/math-comp/mczify) (lia for MathComp): [see installation instructions](https://github.com/math-comp/mczify/blob/master/README.md).

Tested with Coq 8.20.0, MathComp 2.2.0, Ollibs 2.0.7, Graph Theory 0.9.5, Mczify 1.5.0+2.0+8.16.
